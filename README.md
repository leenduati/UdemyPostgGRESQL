# PostgreSQL Python Script for Database Table Management

This project demonstrates how to manage a PostgreSQL database table using Python and the `psycopg2` library. The script connects to a PostgreSQL database, creates a table, inserts sample data, alters the table to add a new column, and updates the new column values for each row.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.x**: This script requires Python 3 and has been tested with Python 3.6+.
2. **PostgreSQL**: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and a database created for the project.
3. **Python Libraries**:
   - `psycopg2` and `psycopg2.extras`: These libraries allow you to connect to PostgreSQL and manage the database.

To install the `psycopg2` library:
```bash
pip install psycopg2
```

---

## Project Setup

1. **Database Configuration**:
   - Update the `hostname`, `port_id`, `password_id`, `user_name`, and `database_name` variables to match your PostgreSQL configuration.

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and that you can connect to the database specified by `database_name`.

---

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single Python script:

- `db_script.py`: The main script which connects to PostgreSQL, creates a table, inserts data, alters the table, and updates values.

---

## Functionality

The script performs the following steps:
1. **Connects to PostgreSQL**: Establishes a connection using the credentials specified.
2. **Creates a Table**: Creates a table named `lee` with columns `id`, `name`, and `email`.
3. **Inserts Sample Data**: Adds three rows of data to the table.
4. **Alters Table**: Adds an `AGE` column to the table.
5. **Updates Column Values**: Sets the `AGE` values for each row.
6. **Fetches and Prints Data**: Retrieves and prints the table data as a dictionary.

---

## Code Walkthrough

Below is an explanation of each part of the code in `db_script.py`.

### Imports and Setup

```python
import psycopg2 as pg
import psycopg2.extras as pgdict
```

- `psycopg2` and `psycopg2.extras` are imported to manage the PostgreSQL connection and enable dictionary-based data retrieval.

### Database Connection Parameters

```python
hostname = 'localhost'
port_id = '5432'
password_id = 'november'
user_name = 'postgres'
database_name = 'Sample'
```

- Configure these parameters with your PostgreSQL connection details.

### Main Script

1. **Connecting to the Database**

   The script connects to the database using a try-except-finally block. If any error occurs, the connection closes automatically.

2. **Creating and Managing the Table**

   - **Table Creation**:
     The script creates a table named `lee` with columns `id`, `name`, and `email`.
   - **Inserting Data**:
     Three rows of sample data are inserted into the `lee` table.
   - **Altering the Table**:
     Adds a new column `AGE`.
   - **Updating Data**:
     Each row’s `AGE` column is updated individually using the `id` to uniquely identify each row.

3. **Fetching and Printing Data**

   - Data is retrieved using a dictionary cursor, allowing data to be referenced by column name. The final output is printed in a structured way.

---

## Usage

To run the script:

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running and that your database is accessible.
2. Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python db_script.py
   ```

Upon running, you should see the inserted data with each name and email printed as per the script’s final fetch operation.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Errors**:
   Ensure that PostgreSQL is running and that the credentials and database name are correctly set.
  
- **Module Errors**:
   If `psycopg2` is not found, install it using `pip install psycopg2`.

This script is a basic demonstration of using Python to manage PostgreSQL tables, offering a foundation for building more complex database applications.
